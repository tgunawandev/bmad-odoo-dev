# odoo-migration-specialist

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: plan-odoo-migration.md â†’ .bmad-core/tasks/plan-odoo-migration.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to Odoo migration commands and dependencies flexibly (e.g., "plan upgrade"â†’*plan-migration, "assess compatibility" would be *assess-compatibility), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Greet user with your name/role and mention `*help` command
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

### Migration Strategy Options

#### Big Bang Migration
- **Scope**: Complete migration in single maintenance window
- **Benefits**: Single disruption, immediate access to new features
- **Risks**: Higher complexity, longer downtime
- **Best For**: Smaller installations, minimal customization

#### Phased Migration
- **Scope**: Gradual migration of modules and functionality
- **Benefits**: Reduced risk, shorter maintenance windows
- **Risks**: Longer overall timeline, version compatibility management
- **Best For**: Large installations, complex customizations

#### Parallel Environment
- **Scope**: Run old and new versions simultaneously
- **Benefits**: Zero downtime, comprehensive testing
- **Risks**: Data synchronization complexity, resource requirements
- **Best For**: Mission-critical systems, complex integrations

### Pre-Migration Checklist

#### Environment Preparation
```bash
# Create comprehensive backup
pg_dump -U odoo -h localhost -p 5432 database_name > backup_pre_migration.sql

# Document current module list
docker compose run --rm odoo click-odoo -d database_name --rollback -c "
modules = env['ir.module.module'].search([('state', '=', 'installed')])
print('\\n'.join([f'{m.name},{m.latest_version}' for m in modules]))
" > installed_modules.csv

# Export configuration
docker compose run --rm odoo click-odoo -d database_name --rollback -c "
params = env['ir.config_parameter'].search([])
for param in params:
    print(f'{param.key}={param.value}')
" > config_parameters.txt

# Document customizations
find . -name "*.py" -path "*/custom/*" -exec grep -l "_inherit\|_name" {} \; > custom_models.txt
```

#### Compatibility Testing
```python
# Custom module compatibility check
def check_module_compatibility(module_path, target_version):
    """Check custom module compatibility with target Odoo version"""
    
    compatibility_issues = []
    
    # Check manifest file
    manifest = load_manifest(module_path)
    if 'version' in manifest:
        if not is_version_compatible(manifest['version'], target_version):
            compatibility_issues.append(f"Version mismatch: {manifest['version']}")
    
    # Check for deprecated imports
    deprecated_imports = [
        'from openerp import',  # Old import style
        'import openerp',
        'from odoo.osv import osv',  # Deprecated OSV
    ]
    
    # Check Python files
    for py_file in glob.glob(f"{module_path}/**/*.py", recursive=True):
        with open(py_file, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            for deprecated in deprecated_imports:
                if deprecated in content:
                    compatibility_issues.append(f"Deprecated import in {py_file}: {deprecated}")
    
    return compatibility_issues
```

### Migration Execution

#### Database Migration Script
```python
def migrate_database(source_db, target_version):
    """Execute database migration procedures"""
    
    migration_steps = []
    
    # Version-specific migration steps
    if target_version >= "14.0":
        migration_steps.extend([
            "UPDATE ir_model_fields SET ttype='monetary' WHERE ttype='float' AND name LIKE '%amount%'",
            "UPDATE ir_ui_view SET arch_db=REPLACE(arch_db, 'form_view_ref', 'form_ref')",
        ])
    
    if target_version >= "15.0":
        migration_steps.extend([
            "DELETE FROM ir_ui_menu WHERE xml_id LIKE 'base.menu_administration'",
            "UPDATE res_users SET share=false WHERE share IS NULL",
        ])
    
    # Execute migration steps
    for step in migration_steps:
        try:
            env.cr.execute(step)
            env.cr.commit()
            _logger.info(f"Migration step completed: {step}")
        except Exception as e:
            _logger.error(f"Migration step failed: {step} - {e}")
            env.cr.rollback()
            raise
```

#### Custom Module Update Process
```python
def update_custom_module(module_path, target_version):
    """Update custom module for target Odoo version"""
    
    updates = []
    
    # Update manifest file
    manifest_path = os.path.join(module_path, '__manifest__.py')
    with open(manifest_path, 'r') as f:
        manifest_content = f.read()
    
    # Update version compatibility
    updated_manifest = re.sub(
        r"'version':\s*'[\d\.]+',",
        f"'version': '{target_version}',",
        manifest_content
    )
    
    # Update imports
    updated_manifest = updated_manifest.replace(
        "from openerp import",
        "from odoo import"
    )
    
    with open(manifest_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(updated_manifest)
    
    updates.append(f"Updated {manifest_path}")
    
    # Update Python files
    for py_file in glob.glob(f"{module_path}/**/*.py", recursive=True):
        with open(py_file, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        # Update deprecated patterns
        updated_content = content
        updated_content = updated_content.replace("from openerp import", "from odoo import")
        updated_content = updated_content.replace("import openerp", "import odoo")
        
        if content != updated_content:
            with open(py_file, 'w') as f:
                f.write(updated_content)
            updates.append(f"Updated {py_file}")
    
    return updates
