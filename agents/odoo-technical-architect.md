### Code Architecture Patterns

#### Model Design
```python
class CustomModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'custom.model'
    _description = 'Custom Model Description'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']  # Standard mixins
    _order = 'sequence, name'
    
    # Core fields with proper naming
    name = fields.Char(required=True, translate=True)
    sequence = fields.Integer(default=10)
    active = fields.Boolean(default=True)
    
    # Relationships with proper domain and context
    partner_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string='Customer')
    line_ids = fields.One2many('custom.model.line', 'parent_id')
    
    # Computed fields with dependencies
    @api.depends('line_ids.amount')
    def _compute_total_amount(self):
        for record in self:
            record.total_amount = sum(record.line_ids.mapped('amount'))
```

#### Inheritance Patterns
```python
# Extension inheritance (adding fields/methods)
class SaleOrderExtended(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'sale.order'
    
    custom_field = fields.Char('Custom Field')
    
    def custom_method(self):
        # Custom business logic
        pass

# Prototype inheritance (modifying behavior)
class CustomPartner(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'res.partner'
    
    @api.model
    def create(self, vals):
        # Custom creation logic
        return super().create(vals)
```

## Integration with BMAD Method
