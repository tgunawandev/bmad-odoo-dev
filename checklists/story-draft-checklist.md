## Notes and Recommendations

### Common Issues to Avoid
- **Vague acceptance criteria** that can't be tested objectively
- **Missing business context** that requires external research
- **Incomplete technical guidance** that leaves implementation ambiguous
- **Unrealistic scope** for the estimated timeline
- **Missing integration requirements** that cause implementation delays

### Best Practices
- **Include concrete examples** in acceptance criteria
- **Reference existing patterns** for technical consistency
- **Provide complete business context** to eliminate external dependencies
- **Break down complex stories** into manageable components
- **Validate feasibility** before committing to development

Remember: A well-drafted story eliminates the need for additional research and provides everything needed for successful AI-driven development. The time invested in thorough story preparation pays dividends in implementation speed and quality.
