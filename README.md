## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+ (BMAD-METHOD core will be installed automatically)
- Existing Odoo project (recommended) or new project setup

### Installation

```bash
# Simple one-command installation (installs both BMAD-METHOD core and Odoo expansion)
npx bmad-method-odoo install
```

That's it! This single command will:
- Install BMAD-METHOD core (if not already installed)
- Set up the Odoo expansion pack
- Copy team configuration files to your project
- No local compilation or npm install required

### Alternative Installation

If you prefer the traditional approach:

```bash
# Install both packages locally
npm install bmad-method bmad-method-odoo

# Then run setup
npx bmad-odoo install
```

## Usage

### 1. Web UI Planning Phase

The installation process automatically copies team files to your project directory. Simply upload the team file to your AI agent:

**File**: `team-odoo-fullstack.txt` (already in your project directory)  
**Instructions**: *"Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"*

Start planning:
- `*odoo-functional-consultant` - Business process analysis
- `*odoo-technical-architect` - System architecture design  
- `*odoo-developer` - Technical implementation planning

### 2. IDE Development Phase

Once you have your PRD and Architecture documents:

```bash
# Shard your documents for development
npx bmad-method shard

# Start development with Odoo-specific agents
# Open stories in docs/stories/ and work with specialized agents
```

### 3. Odoo-Specific Commands

Available through the `*OdooMethod` slash prefix:

- `*OdooMethod create-addon` - Generate new addon from requirements
- `*OdooMethod enhance-existing` - Plan brownfield enhancements
- `*OdooMethod plan-migration` - Structure version upgrade
- `*OdooMethod doodba-deploy` - Deployment planning and execution

## Supported Odoo Environments
