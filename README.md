### Alternative Installation

If you prefer the traditional approach:

```bash
# Install both packages locally
npm install bmad-method bmad-odoo-dev

# Then run setup
npx bmad-odoo install
```

   "I need to create a sales commission addon for multi-tier sales teams"
   ```

2. **Architecture Phase** (Web UI):
   ```
   *odoo-architect  
   "Design the data model and integration points for this sales commission system"
   ```

3. **Story Creation Phase** (Web UI):
   ```
   *odoo-analyst
   "Transform the architecture into detailed development stories for the sales commission system"
   ```

4. **Development Phase** (IDE):
   - Stories created automatically with full context
   - Odoo Developer agent provides ORM guidance and deployment execution

### Enhancing Existing System

1. **Analysis**:
   ```

   "Add approval workflow to purchase orders over $10k"
   ```

2. **Implementation**:
   - Brownfield enhancement patterns
   - Safe inheritance strategies  
   - Integration testing guidance

## Best Practices

### For Odoo Development
